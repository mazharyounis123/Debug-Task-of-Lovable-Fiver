## Overview

This document summarizes a set of bugs that were detected and fixed in the  
Lead Management & Scheduling App.

---

### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Emails

**File**: `src/services/emailService.ts`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed

Users were receiving the same confirmation email twice after submitting a lead.

#### Cause

The email-sending routine was being executed from two different code paths without a check to prevent duplicates.

#### Resolution

Removed the redundant trigger, ensuring the email is only sent once per submission.

#### Outcome

- ✅ Eliminated duplicate notifications
- ✅ Reduced sending costs
- ✅ Lowered spam detection risk

### 2. Industry Data Missing in Leads

**File**: `src/types/Lead.ts`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed

The `industry` value entered by users was missing in stored lead records.

#### Cause

The `Lead` interface lacked the `industry` property after the form was updated.

#### Resolution

Added `industry` to the interface and verified end-to-end data mapping.

#### Outcome

- ✅ All form data stored accurately
- ✅ Improved analytics accuracy
- ✅ Backend matches frontend fields

---

### 3. No Persistent Storage for Leads

**File**: `src/services/databaseService.ts`  
**Priority**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed

Leads vanished if the page was refreshed after submission.

#### Cause

Submission only stored data locally; it never wrote to Supabase.

#### Resolution

Implemented a database insert call in the submission process.

#### Outcome

- ✅ Leads are now permanently saved
- ✅ Eliminated accidental data loss
- ✅ Strengthened backend reliability

### 4. Wrong AI Choice Index

**File**: `src/services/aiHandler.ts`  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed

The AI often responded with fallback messages rather than the intended output.

#### Cause

The code retrieved `choices[1]` instead of `choices[0]` from the API response.

#### Resolution

Corrected the index to `[0]` for accurate AI results.

#### Outcome

- ✅ AI now returns the expected content
- ✅ Fewer fallback cases
- ✅ More consistent user experience

---

### 5. React Router Deprecation Warnings

**File**: `src/routes/routerConfig.ts`  
**Priority**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed

Console logs displayed deprecation warnings related to upcoming React Router v7 changes.

#### Cause

Two future flags — `startTransition` and `relativeSplatPath` — were missing from the router configuration.

#### Resolution

Added both flags as per the v7 migration guide.

#### Outcome

- ✅ No more warning clutter in console
- ✅ Router setup is ready for v7
